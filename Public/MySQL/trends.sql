I was also diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis.\r\n\r\np$“Fast forward to 2022, these cyst had reoccurred. The left cyst on my left ovary actually came back ‘stronger’ than before. So I was told I have to undergo surgery to remove the left ovary and left cyst in order to protect the right one, so that I can go ahead and do egg freezing.\r\n\r\np$“And I was saying ‘God by April I don’t want to see these cysts in my body again. I want something new, something different.’\r\n\r\np$“April scans came, the cysts had reduced in size and I said, ‘God, I receive it, I’m grateful. However, this healing is not complete.’\r\n\r\np$“Surgery was scheduled for the 4th 0f July. On the 1st of July I went to do my pre-surgery scans and before I left, I said to God that I want this scan to be different, and I felt it in my spirit that the Holy spirit was telling me, ‘Tomorrow, you’ll know.’\r\n\r\np$“So I went for the scan. The radiologist said he could see the left cyst, however the right one has reabsorbed and I asked ‘what’s the difference in the size?’. He said, ‘I can’t see it, it’s not there anymore.\'”\r\n\r\nThe actress said she cancelled her scheduled surgery due to scan, and resumed prayers, believing God will perfect the miracle. She afterwards visited another doctor who diagnosed her with a blocked fallopian tube after a MRI scan.\r\n\r\np$According to her, it was during the discussion of treatments for the blocked fallopian tube that it was discovered she no longer had cysts in her body.\r\n\r\np$“Beginning of September, I went to do a MRI scan as recommended by this doctor. He told me, ‘This is treatable. These are the options you have for this’. So I said, ‘When it’s time for egg freezing, they’re going to inject me with hormones, so how is this going to affect the left cyst that is still there?’ So he told me, ‘There is no cyst’. I asked, ‘what do you mean?’\r\n\r\np$“And he says ‘Thank God you didn’t go through surgery but there is no cysts in your body.’\r\n\r\np$“I’ve wanted to be that woman that sits here and testifies. And I said to God, ‘If you can give me my miracle, I’d sit and testify that truly, what God cannot do, doesn’t exist.”\r\n\r\np$Balogun had earlier spoken out about her struggle with endometriosis, a disorder where tissue appears outside a woman’s uterus.\r\n\r\np$Sharing her experience in March, the endometriosis awareness month, the actress stated in an Instagram post that the ailment had caused her “vicious pain” for more than 20 years.'),

The Speaker, Hon. Funminiyi Afuye, was snatched by the cold hands of death.\r\n\r\np$His demise was mysterious to some and this necessitated why different meanings were read to his sudden, devastating  and wondrous departure. While some said it could be spiritual, the other school of thought attributed it to the call of nature and destiny.\r\n\r\np$In a manner suggestive that of an excruciating regret and teeth gnatching, one of the assembly members while responding to his departure said: “This incident  was funny and shocking. Rt. Hon Funminiyi Afuye was at the House of Assembly yesterday(Tuesday), so his death was devastating to us. It was a rude shock. We learnt he developed sudden complications this morning and was rushed to the hospital, where he died”.\r\n\r\np$Dramatically, Afuye  appeared at the inauguration of Governor Biodun Oyebanji, on Sunday hale and healthy. He was bubbling with life, with no premonition of death. He  was said to have also attended the plenary on Tuesday, after which he joined Governor Biodun Oyebanji on inspection of some projects in the state capital, Ado Ekiti.  These attested to how surprising, unpredictable  and incredulous death could be.\r\n\r\np$It was not gainsaid that the assumption of  Governor Oyebanji  onto the governorship seat on October 16, 2022 altered the political matrix and configuration of the state. His coming seems to have tilted the  political calculation  in favour of Ekiti South Senatorial District.\r\n\r\np$The Zone that had cried loudly over marginalisation has the Deputy Governor, Mrs Monisade Afuye and the Speaker coming from the district with Ekiti North now dislodged from the major first three ranking positions, with former Governor Kayode Fayemi’s exit. Knew what they were, politicians don’t normally take chances. Their case is like a nature, it abhors vacuum.\r\n\r\np$Reports from the assembly indicated that underground and surreptitious scramble for the speakership had started even before Fayemi exited. Reliable sources confirmed that some lawmakers of Northern extraction had started the permutations targeted at dislodging Afuye to cede the position to Ekiti North that seems sidelined in the equation. This was to ensure political balancing\r\n\r\np$But before these clandestine debate hots up, the nature brought out its own calculus and took away Afuye, who represented Ikere constituency 1, at the age of 66. Though he had hardlining supporters among the lawmakers, who shared the view that the late speaker should be allowed to complete his tenure on June 6, 2023.'),

The reason is that there is diversity when it comes to that. Therefore, sticking to one faith is not a good thing to do particularly in a troubled nation as we are in today. It’s almost like going on to having the presidential candidate  from the North and picking the vice presidential candidate also from the North.”\r\n\r\np$As a result of the ruling party’s action, the Delta State governor said it would be difficult for the APC to win the presidential poll.\r\n\r\np$“So, the only ticket that can work for Nigeria is the ticket that doe not tie election victory to either the Muslim or Christian faith,” he stressed.\r\n\r\np$The summit was organised by the Northern Christian Youth Assembly with the theme, “Unifying Nigeria: The role of Northern Christian youths and women.”\r\n\r\n p$Okowa told the youth that with their support, the party would win the 2023 elections.\r\n\r\np$He said the PDP had been receiving several defectors, adding that more people were joining the Atiku/Okowa project.\r\n\r\np$While commending the group for organising the meeting to discuss Nigeria’s challenges and the pathways to finding solutions, he advised everyone to prepare to vote in the coming poll.\r\n\r\np$“The PDP will win the election because many people have keyed into this project. We are receiving defectors in droves. When we say that the future is for the youth, it is actually from today. But the real truth is, our youths, particularly the youth leaders must be in a position to have a clear understanding so that they are able to guide others aright. This is because if you have a leadership that is not able to provide that true leadership of guiding people alright and people begin to think in the wrong way, you create further problems rather than finding solutions; and we go the wrong path.\r\n\r\n“We are going to see bullying in the cyberspace of our country. I think that everybody should have his space and time to be able to think and make comments without being bullied. We need to do critical thinking and that is why we are gathered here today.\r\n\r\n“The topic for the event is key because it talks about unifying Nigeria. This is instructive because there is strength in our diversity but that will only be when we are able to unite ourselves.\r\n\r\np$Unemployment  rising\r\np$Also, Atiku, who spoke at the Private Sector Economic Forum on the 2023 Presidential Elections organised by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Lagos, stated that  the APC-led administration had overseen a regime that had been responsible for a massive and regrettable level of unemployment in the country.\r\n\r\np$Delivering a scathing assessment of the Major Gen Muhammadu Buhari-led administration’s economic performance in a speech titled “Nigeria dresses in borrowed robes,” Atiku said Nigeria had been consistently running on budget deficits since it came to power in 2015.\r\n\r\nHe noted that the budget deficits were often above the three per cent threshold permissible under the Fiscal Responsibility Law.\r\n\r\np$Atiku said for the first time in Nigeria’s history, the Federal Government paid more in debt service than it earned by spending more than 100 per cent of its revenue on debt service.\r\n\r\np$He said job losses, declining purchasing power, per capita income and lack of citizens’ access to basic amenities had pushed more than 90 million people below the poverty line and created more misery for the poor in towns and villages.\r\n\r\np$He said, “On Nigeria’s current unemployment rate, the PDP presidential candidate said, “More than 23 million people are out of jobs, and that in just five years between 2015 and 2020, the number of fully employed people dropped by 54 per cent, from 68 million to 31 million people.”\r\n\r\np$“This year, around 12 per cent of the world population in extreme poverty, with the poverty threshold at 1.90 US dollars a day, live in Nigeria.\r\n\r\np$Basic commodities are now beyond the reach of the average Nigerian. A loaf of bread costs 100 per cent more today than it did in 2020. Farmers now pay more for a bag of fertiliser- if they see it- than they did in 2020.”\r\n\r\np$Noting that Nigeria could not overcome its economic challenges without significant reforms to restructure the economy and support the private sector to unleash its growth potential, the former VP said Nigerian businesses were significantly impacted by business environment constraints and could not realise their full potential.\r\n\r\n“This government has failed to demonstrate a strong commitment to private sector development,” Atiku said.\r\n\r\np$On Nigeria’s economic growth under the APC government, the former Vice President said Nigeria’s economy was crawling rather than growing.\r\n\r\np$According to him, Nigeria’s GDP had grown at an average rate of less than one per cent since the APC assumed power in 2015, compared to average growth of 6.5 per cent in the earlier seven years.\r\n\r\nStating that capital had taken flight, Atiku said policy incoherence and flip-flops combined with internal security had continued to pose a significant risk to investment and output growth.\r\n\r\np$“Foreign Direct Investment has progressively declined since 2019. It fell sharply from $8.5bn in Q1 2019 to $5.8bn in Q1 2020 and $1.9bn I’m Q1 2021.\r\n\r\n“The failure of leadership by the APC-led government is staring every Nigerian in the face as the country’s economic, social, political and security challenges persist and assume frightening dimensions,” Atiku stated.\r\n\r\np$Shittu replies attack\r\np$As of the time of filing this report, the Director of Media and Publicity for APC Presidential Campaign Council, Bayo Onanuga and the National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka, could not be reached for reaction on Atiku and Okowa’s comments.\r\n\r\nBut Director-General of the Asiwaju Tinubu-Shettima Coalition for Good Governance, Adebayo Shittu, hit out at Atiku and his running mate, describing them as ‘’unrepentant PDP leaders that deserve to cover their faces in shame.”\r\n\r\np$He said, “They have nothing else to say. The antecedents of Tinubu, who is known to be fishers of men has seen him choose the very best brain; somebody who is articulate, brilliant and ruled Borno State in a war-situation and did exceedingly well. This has unsettled them. Tell me, who could have been a better APC candidate to choose from the North-East?\r\n\r\np$On the 54 per cent unemployment rate, the former Communications Minister said the situation was not peculiar to only Nigeria.\r\n\r\n“Is it peculiar to us alone? We should be able to compare with other nations before drawing a conclusion. Even in Britain and the US, what is the situation like? Are you aware that Britain is currently experiencing increment in prices of bread and other essentials?\r\n\r\np$Atiku meets Jandour\r\np$Meanwhile, the former VP at earlier programme with stakeholders in Lagos, said he was marvelled by the level of mobilisation of party members  in Lagos State ahead of the  2023 general elections, according to a News Agency of Nigeria report.\r\n\r\np$“Now, in all my political career, we are the people who established the PDP,  I have never seen Lagos state so mobilised like this.\r\n\r\np$“This makes me believe that this electoral time, PDP is going to win Lagos. I believe you are going to win Lagos state this time around,” the PDP presidential candidate said.\r\n\r\np$In his remarks, Olajide Adediran (Jandor), the governorship candidate of PDP in Lagos state, said the people of the state had never been so hopeful with Atiku.\r\n\r\np$Adediran said the party members in the state had spoken to themselves and had decided to focus only on Abubakar as “the Project 2023.”\r\n\r\np$The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Atiku was accompanied by former governor of Niger State,  Babangida Aliyu, Sen.

The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Transportation, Dr Magdalene Ajani, said this recently at a one-day sensitisation meeting organised by the FMOT in collaboration with NSC themed, “Promoting Competitiveness & Compliance in Nigerian Maritime Industry: Mandate of the NSC in Focus.” She explained that while NPA was the technical operational regulator, the NSC was interim economic regulator of the ports. “Consequently, the Shippers Council’s port economic regulatory mandate and roles should be reflected in the Port Concession agreement under review and other subsequent agreements.” \r\np$Ajani, who is also the chairman of the occasion, noted that the ministry was aware that the shippers’ council had faced resistance from relevant stakeholders in the maritime industry in the earlier stages of the implementation of the economic regulator regulation. “It is noteworthy that prior to the appointment of the Council as an interim port economic regulator, there was no known authority saddled with the responsibility of checkmating the commercial activities at the port.\r\np$I also want us to note that while NSC is the port economic regulator, the Nigerian Ports Authority remains the technical operational regulator. This is very key so that we understand the distinct role between the two agencies and stakeholders give their support and cooperation to them.” Dr Ajani informed the gathering that the Nigerian Shippers’ Council was appointed as the interim port economic regulator in 2014 as a government response to fill the vacuum and address the challenges facing the port system.\r\n\r\np$According to her, the major objective of the government in appointing the Nigerian Shippers’ Council as the interim port economic regulator was to create an effective regulatory regime at the port for the control of tariffs, charges and other related economic services by the virtue of economic regulatory order No 34 of 2015 issued by the President in pursuant to section 5 and 145 of the 1999 Constitution as gazetted.\r\np$While calling for the support and cooperation of all stakeholders, Ajani said the ministry was working on stakeholders’ concerns and implementation of some of the suggestions made in the past in order to bring out the best options in collaborating actively with agencies outside the Federal Ministry of Transportation. “In line with the sub-existing order on the port economic regulation, as issued by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I hereby reaffirm that the NSC remains the interim Port economic regulator in our nation’s ports pending the establishment and operationalisation of the National Transport Commission as an independent regulatory authority in the transport sector,” Ajani noted.\r\np$On his part, the Managing Director of the NPA, Mr Mohammed Bello-Koko, said the NSC had come into a tight-packed sector of government, which was the maritime industry, adding that all stakeholders needed to adjust and accommodate its regulations which were already backed up by law. Bello-Koko, who was represented at the event by the NPA legal secretary, Mr IG Umar, charged the council to make more efforts in extending the competitiveness of Nigerian port operations to the world. He also thanked the Federal Ministry of Transport for its immense support for the growth and empowerment of the NSC.');

The party chieftain, who frowned at the perennial romance between the ruling party and the governor, emphasised that Wike needed not be coaxed to join the APC if he was genuinely convinced the APC had done well.\r\n\r\np$He said, “As a result of our performance, if Governor Wike wants to join the party he must come in through the front door. We will receive him and save him from those he claimed wants to destroy his political future.”\r\n\r\np$The development is coming barely 48 hours after the Rivers State Governor labelled his predecessor, Rotimi Amaechi, a failure for not bringing development to his home state as Minister of Transportation.\r\n\r\nWike also knocked Amaechi for saying the Rivers State Government did not give state burial to late four-time Minister Alabo Graham-Douglas, when he himself did nothing when the ailing elder statesman was alive.\r\n\r\np$An emotional Wike, who spoke at the inauguration of the re-constructed ultra-modern seven-storey office complex in Port Harcourt on Monday, noted that even the Rail Line done in other parts of the country under Amaechi’s supervision, never got to the former minister’s state while he held the position for seven years.\r\n\r\np$But in what appeared to be a subtle reaction to Wike’s outburst, Agbomere warned stalwarts of the ruling APC to stop hobnobbing with the Rivers State Governor.\r\n\r\np$The APC zonal scribe expressed concerns that Wike’s frequent invitation to top party leaders of the APC for projects commissioning in Port Harcourt would not project the party well ahead of the presidential and Rivers State governorship elections in 2023.\r\n\r\np$This was as he lamented that the influx of party chieftains into Rivers State and ‘unhealthy’ romance with Wike were killing the motivation of the APC members in the state.\r\n\r\np$Agbomere also expressed regret that many of the APC chiefs who had so far visited Rivers State had shunned the prospect of meeting with their leaders and failed to identify with the leadership of the APC during their stay in Rivers State.\r\n\r\np$“We want to call on the National leadership of the APC to urgently call some party chieftains who are now flocking to Rivers State and maintaining unholy alliances with Wike in the name of commissioning projects, to order.\r\n\r\np$“While there is nothing wrong with inviting a highly placed personality to inaugurate unfinished projects, everything is wrong if such uncompleted projects are being used as campaign stunts ahead crucial national elections at hand.\r\n\r\n“By identifying with an opposition party at this time, such leaders are indirectly de-marketing our great party especially in a state controlled by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party.\r\n\r\np$“It is unfortunate that the influx of such APC chieftains into the state has proved highly discouraging to members of the Rivers State chapter of the APC who are striving and strategising daily on how to win positions in the state during the forthcoming general election.\r\n\r\np$“The earlier this unholy pilgrimage of our highly revered party stalwarts to Rivers State is nipped in the bud by the national leadership of the party, the better for the APC’s chances in the forthcoming elections in the state,” he said.\r\n\r\np$The South-South zonal organising secretary warned that the region was critical for the APC if it hoped to win the forthcoming presidential, governorship and legislative elections in South-South geo-political zone.\r\n\r\np$“We cannot afford to promote the policies and projects of an opposition ruling party in a state on the one hand and expect to win elections in that state as an opposition party,” he added.\r\n\r\np$As of the time of filing this report, the APC National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka, could not be reached for reaction.'),
